&lt;p>Every time I went downstairs and saw the bus arriving from afar, I would silently sigh and then maintain the same speed and walk over to the bus, and halfway there, the bus would drive away. So every time I remind myself that maybe I just saw the bus arriving when I went downstairs, so I just need to run and I can catch it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But thoughts are thoughts, and every time I encountered this situation, my legs felt like they were filled with lead, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t step forward, maintain the same speed, just walk past, and then watch the bus drive away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last time I went out, I saw a bus coming again, I suddenly ran, it had been five seconds, there were no passengers getting on or off the bus. Well, I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t catch up even if I ran. But the driver saw me running and instead of starting, he waited for me, so I caught up.&lt;/p>
